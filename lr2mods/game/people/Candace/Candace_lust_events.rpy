# The default candace event series. Since she is already a bimbo, she starts at 40 sluttiness, which will compact this storyline considerably.
# In Candace's lust arc, we use her slutty aspects to enhance the supply division.
# She "accidentally" discovers new methods for getting cheap deals on supplies and for increasing supply rates, usually by capitalizing on some sexual performance.
# Once unlocked, others in the supply division can be assigned the same duties to mimic her performance.
# Using her sexual prowess for business gains puts her in conflict with Sarah and Sarah's obedience path.
# Progression in Sarah's obedience path opens a teamup for Candace and Sarah as you try to train similar traits into Sarah.
