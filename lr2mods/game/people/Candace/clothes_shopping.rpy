#This file contains the generic clothes shopping label as well as Candace specific version.
#Clothes shopping is unlocked after Candace takes you.
#Label starts out at a regular store, girl tries on three outfits. If players approves of less than 2, she prompts player to pick something out.
#After, based on sluttiness,  she picks out a set of new underwear. If not slutty, it's regular underwear. If moderately slutty, it's lingerie. If very slutty, pulls MC into room with her for sex scene.
#Anytime girl tries on outfit that she REALLY likes, if she works for MC, asks MC to wear to work. If yes, add outfit to her department uniform options.
#TODO, should we give option to add outfit to player's outfit selection?
