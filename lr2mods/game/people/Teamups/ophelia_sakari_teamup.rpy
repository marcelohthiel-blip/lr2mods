#Notes: I want to use a separate file from now on for contain all team-up code and dialogue.
#Erica and other files are getting TOO LONG and need to be paired down accordingly
#Sakari's planned teamups are with Ophelia and eventually someone in MC's family.
#Jennifer would be ideal, with Sakari offering her a job at the clothes store. However, unsure of how things will progress with vanilla Jennifer
# Rebecca makes sense and also already has a team-up planned for rebecca and ophelia, making the three of them a prime harem start possibility.

#Sakari's ophelia team-up should start right after her skinny dipping scene and before her blowjob scene, and somewhere around her 40 love scene. Implications are that ophelia gives her some blowjob tips.
#Ophelia needs to have progress her salon to the point of offering massage services. Sakari teaming up with her slows her weekly energy loss by going to the spa.
# Rebecca's team-up should only occur if Sakari is cured. Rebecca is shopping at the store and MC sees her, introduces her to the shop owner, they become friends.
