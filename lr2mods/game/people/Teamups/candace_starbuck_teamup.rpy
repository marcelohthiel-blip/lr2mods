    the_person "No, but they might be the same size. It's the largest, suction cup mounted double dildo on the market!"

    "Quietly, you continue working on the pallet of merchandise. You wonder if there is any way you could help her out."
    "As you think about it though, the amount of straight... Training... It would take to fuck that size is prohibitive. Maybe you could find someone else who could do it?"

    mc.name "Well, unfortunately, it also destroyed most of her common sense. She is basically a dim witted bimbo."

    mc.name "Maybe I could just bring her out here for a bit? We won't necessarily ask her to do it, but just get a feel for how she might respond. It would only be fair though, that we pay her some for her part in the demo."
