# SAKARI OUTLINE
# Sakari is Kaya's mother, who is in failing health due to a bloodborn disease. She doesn't actually meet MC until later in the game (EG pacing with Candace)
# Sakari's intro event is paced based on having Ellie doing IT projects, since that means the business is somewhere in tier 2. Sakari's story is the first that is TIME SENSITIVE
# Sakari starts at 100 max energy, and it drops by 5 every week. Upon reaching <50, MC gets a notification that Sakari has gone to the hospital, then hospice, then passes away.
# Sakari's love events will give MC the opportunity to research a cure for her, but it will be very expensive. Alternatively, MC can try and make her remaining days "as pleasurable as possible"
# We introduce Sakari at the clothes store, which we discover she owns. Her 20 love event involves MC discovering the nature of her affliction, at 40 she offers to sell MC her business
# At 60 love she wants to be with MC for what is left of her time if she hasn't been cured yet. If MC cures sakari before she gets to 60 love, she bypasses the 60 love event and goes to 80 love event
# 80 love event only activates if Sakari has been cured, and she basically offers to be MC's personal MILF, even if MC is also dating Kaya.
# At 100 love if Kaya is also at 100 love they offer to move in with MC. Kaya's love quests involve MC talking with Lily and Jennifer about their relationship, so it is not a surprise to them.
# Sakari's sluttiness events basically revolve around doing slutty things she never got to do during her life.
# At 20 she skinny dips with MC at night
# at 40 she blows MC at the movie theatre
# at 60 she fucks MC in a dressing room at her clothing store
# at 80 she asks MC if she can dance at his strip club for one night (must own strip club)
# at 100 she offers to join MC's harem if he has one, if not and 100 sluttiness with Kaya she has a threesome with her and MC.

#Starts with MC talking to Ellie about Nanobots. during a nighttime mandatory crisis MC realises nanobots could be used to target Sakari's sickness.
#First prototype kills lab rats because bots are either too effective and flood the system with dead cells, or not effective enough and the illness comes back
#Second phase create a new serum type to combat the effects of the necrosis of the nanobot tech
#Put both together into a serum and it will cure sakari if she is given sufficient doses.
