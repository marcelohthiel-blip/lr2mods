🍒The Virgin Tracker MOD: Revolutionizing Your Gameplay Experience🍒

It all started with a simple frustration - the tedious task of searching for specific NPCs on the map. I wanted a way to effortlessly track characters and pinpoint their locations at a glance. This led to the creation of the Tracker Mod, which uses visual icons to streamline your search and make gameplay more enjoyable.

But that was just the beginning. The Virgin Creator Mod took it to the next level by assigning NPCs with virginity, cum stats, and first-time stats upon game load. This added a whole new layer of excitement and realism to the game.

As I refined and expanded these mods, I realized that others could benefit from them too. So, I shared my creations with the community, and the Virgin Tracker Mod 1.0 was born.

Fast forward to today, and we're now at version 4.0. What was once a simple HUD has evolved into a comprehensive tool that provides instant access to vital NPC information, map icons, and more. The result? A significantly enhanced gameplay experience that's more immersive, engaging, and fun.
