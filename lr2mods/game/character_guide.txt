** Game Mechanics **

* Event Timing and Game Speeds *
In order to control the pacing of story related character content, most characters utilize a time delay system between events
Events are split into multiple types, but the most common are Love, Lust, and Obedience events.
There are 4 different tiers of time delays that change based on game speed settings, Quick, Standard, Epic, and Marathon. They are as follows for each game speed.
Tier 0: [-1, 1, 1, 2]   - In standard, these would be events that generally occur daily.
Tier 1: [1, 3, 5, 7]    - In standard, these events should be available twice a week.
Tier 2: [3, 7, 12, 15]  - In standard, these events would occur once a week.
Tier 3: [7, 14[ 20, 30]]    - In standard, these events would occur every couple of weeks.
When the game checks to see if a story event can be run, the standard timing checks for a Tier 2 number of days for any event from the same story, or tier 1 delay from any other story.

Example: Sarah had a lust event on day 15. She would be eligible with standard timing for a love event on day 18, and a new lust event on day 22 with standard timing
Waiting on time delays is often shown in the progress screen as "XYZ needs a few days before she is ready to progress"
In character guides, I will do my best to note when there is non standard timing delays for events.
Events that often have non standard timing: Taboo Breaks, storylines that have multiple events in a row, etc.


** Character Guides **
[CHAR12]
* Jennifer *
* Introduction *
Jennifer is the player character's biological mother. She has a daughter, Lily, a sister, Rebecca, and a niece, Gabrielle, in game.
Her husband and MC's father is not in game for unknown reasons.
In the previous Lab Rats game, she was a recipient of early serum creations and still has a faint memory of the actions from the first game.
At the beginning of the game, she takes out a home equity loan to finance MC's new pharmaceutical business, while she works an office job of her own to pay bills.
Jennifer is accessible from the start of the game and has multiple side stories and story arcs.
As a family member, sexual encounters with Jennifer use her opinion of Incest to modify sluttiness requirements.
She also has a series of taboo break quests that occur as MC advances sexually with her.
Sexual positions are locked behind her taboo quests, EG only foreplay is available until kissing event is complete.

*Taboo Breaks*
These events occur automatically in response to MC breaking her taboos. There are four stages to these events.
Each stage has a list of relevant taboos it looks for to be broken, and when one gets broken it will trigger an event the next day.

Kissing - Relevant taboos: Bare Tits, Bare Pussy, Kissing, Touching Body, Touching Vagina
Completion requirements:
    - Jennifer likes or loves Incest

    - Broken relevant taboo a number of times (8 - her opinion of vaginal)
    - Be her boss

* Love Events *
Currently, Jennifer's only love based events invole getting her to agree to have a secret romantic relationship with MC.
To begin this set of events, MC must first be able to ask her to become his girlfriend, which requires a base Love score of 60
Once asked, players need to be able to complete one of the following conditions:
- Pay $5000
- Jennifer has 200 obedience
- Jennifer is pregnant with MC's child
After this, a second check must be made which currently only has 2 passing conditions.
- Jennifer like or loves Incest
- Jennifer AND MC BOTH have 4 or more charisma (Jennifer starts the game with 4 charisma)
After this, a third and final check occurs, requiring MC to convince Lily to be okay with the relationship. To pass this check, one of the following conditions must be met.
- MC convinces Lily to accept the relationship (Explained next)
- Lily is already dating MC
- Lily has an Intelligence of 1 or 0
If Players take the route that requires concvincing Lily to be okay with the relationship, they can approach and talk to her.
The conditions for her to be okay with the relationship is atleast one of the following.
- Lily likes or loves Incest
- Pay Lily $10000 OR negotiate down to $5000 with a love score penalty
- Lily Obedience score of at least 200
Once Lily has been convinced, or if one of the previous conditions was met, MC convinces Jennifer to become his girlfriend, and she gains girlfriend status.
*NOTE*: There is not currently any unique content for Jennifer if she is MC's girlfriend.

* Lust Events *
Jennifer has 2 separate lust story arcs.
Her lust story arc initially involves her becoming her workplace's slut, and involves themes around her having sex with her boss with MC's knowledge and permission.
Her alternate lust story has MC convince her to quit her job and become MC's personal secretary. At this time, this arc is not filled in with story content.

* Office Slut Arc *
Jennifer begins her office slut arc when reaching a sluttiness score of 30. MC can talk to her on any weekday night in her bedroom and it will begin the event.
In the first event, Jennifer indicates she is applying for a promotion. She asks MC for advice.
If players suggest to advantage of her womanly charms, they have an opportunity to create a sexy outfit for her. They also get a small stat bump in the follow up event.
After a few days, Jennifer will have another event available where she share the result of the initial interview.
2-4 days later, she let's MC know that she is up for her second round interview.
MC can then help Jennifer prep for her interview any Evening of Night time slot until her interview day
*NOTE* If players fail to help her prep for her interview, she will fail her interview and will not be hired as a personal secretary. At this time, this cannot be reversed.
If MC instructed Jennifer to be slutty, or to be friendly and have a slutty outfit, she will get the promotion to secretary.
Otherwise, Jennifer does receive the promotion and does not continue this arc. This cannot be reversed.

The next event requires 7 days to pass since her promotion and a sluttiness score of at least 40.
Jennifer approaches MC with a fear of being replaced, giving him Four options.
- Seduce your boss. This option completes this event, and gives players the opportunity to get a look and Jennifer's tits or a blowjob.
- Get bigger tits. To complete this, MC must help Jennifer go up in breast size. Detailed below.
- I'll take care of it. MC agrees to talk to her boss to see if he can find out what is going on. Detailed below
- Do Nothing.  This option is actually identical to the one above, but with different dialogue. MC must approach Jennifer's boss to continue.

If Player's choose option 3 or 4 from above, they can then go the Jennifer's work and talk to her boss.
At the beginning of this event, player's will also be introduced to Iris, the daughter of Jennifer's boss, if they haven't already met her.
Once meeting her boss, MC is presented with a choice. Choose between:
- I want to help you. Player's set a foundation for future cooperation with Jennifer's boss.
- I want you to back off. Player's set Jennifer's boss as a future rival.
Regardless of the player's decision, they can than have a quick date with Iris.
After the date, regardless of the outcome, players must then help Jennifer get bigger tits to continue this story arc.

Get bigger tits. This event requires MC to help Jennifer get a more sizeable chest. Talk to her about it to initiate this action.
To successfully complete this action, players must complete one of the following:
- Pay $7,000 for implants
- Give her a breast increasing serum
- Jennifer has obedience of at least 130 and love of 30, and she is willing to pay for it herself.

If player's instructed Jennifer to seduce her boss or get bigger tits, she will report her success a few days later.

Jennifer's next event is a bridge event, requiring only standard time spacing from her previous event
She will give MC an update on her office slut antics in the kitchen. If she previously only offer her boss her tits, she now updates to giving him blowjobs.

Jennifer's next event requires 60 sluttiness, standard event timing, and occurs in the kitchen.
Jennifer reveals her boss has been paying prostitutes and is in distress.
Player's convince her to fuck her boss, and if the positions are available, have the option of fucking her vaginally or anally.
Jennifer will have a follow up event with MC TIER_1 days later, reporting succesful seduction.
If Jennifer is off birth control at this time, she goes on it and stays on it for as long as she has her current job.

The next event is a short reminder event for MC to check in with Jennifer's boss. It is a standard timing delay until it fires.
After the reminder, MC can go to Jennifer's work again, and approach her boss.

When player's approach Jennifer's boss, if they have met before, they automatically continue their previous path.
If this is their first meeting, player's have a choice
- I've been helping you. Players indicate a desire to work with him. He gives a conditional offer of a partnership if MC can convince Jennifer to go bareback
- Watch your step. Players warn him about indiscretions, and he throws them out. At this time, this is the end of this content.

If player's cooperate with Jennifer's boss, the last scene in the current build requires Jennifer to have at least 70 sluttiness and to love "bareback sex"
Player's can talk to Jennifer in the kitchen and she recounts letting her boss fuck her bare.

This is the end of this story arc for now. Further interactions at work have not yet been written.

*Personal Secretary Arc*
MC can approach Jennifer while she is at work and convince her to quit, ending the above storyline.
Player's can convince her instead to work for them, and if she was already a secretary for her previous boss, they can hire her directly into the personal secretary position.

Jennifer then has a first day at work event, and at the end, player's can "set the tone" for her employment.
The possible endings for this event if she is hired straight to personal secretary are:
Pep talk- the default if no other conditions are met
Tit Fuck- If she was giving her previous boss tit fucks
Blowjob - If she was giving her previous boss blowjobs AND she has completed her first taboo break quest (kissing, nudity)
Sex     - If she was fucking her previous boss AND she has completed her oral sex taboo break.

If players hire Jennifer to the company but not straight to the personal secretary role, they have similar options.
pep talk- the default
Tit Fuck - If her first taboo break is complete (kissing, nudity)
Blowjob - if her oral taboo break is complete
Anal - If her anal sex taboo break is complete
Sex - if her vaginal sex taboo break is complete.

Additional personal secretary content has not yet been completed.

* Obedience Arc *
Jennifer's obedience story arc involves her submitting to MC as he takes over the role of being the man of the house.
There are currently two repeatable scenes in this arc, Saturday Morning Bills and Breakfast in Bed.

This arc begins with Saturday Morning Bills. MC overhears that Jennifer is falling behind on bills and has the opportunity to help out.
This event triggers the first Saturday and every Saturday morning thereafter.

Saturday Morning Bills
This event occurs every SAturday morning. Each week, MC can help with bigger and bigger bills, with each step up increasing Jennifer's obedience more.
Each bill also has a temporary obedience increase that lasts for the duration of this event, and have a slightly higher obedience payout the first time the level is reached.
The options are...
$50 - 1 Obedience (max 120) and 5 temporary obedience
$100 - 5 initially, 2 thereafter (max 140) and 10 temporary obedience
$200 - 5 initially, 2 thereafter (max 160) and 15 temporary obedience
$500 - 7 initially, 2 thereafter (max 180) and 20 temporary obedience
Do Not Contribute - -2 Obedience and the event ends.
The first time MC contributes, Jennifer says thanks and offers to do MC's laundry as thank you.
In subsequent events, Jennifer asks if there is anything she can do to make it up to MC.
Players have the following options:
- Ask for a kiss - Always available
    If Jennifer has a kissing taboo, we break it. If she has 30 effective sluttiness to kissing, we can start a makeout session, allowing progression to any available sex actions
- Just say please - Always available
    No sexual content, but gives a straight +2 additional obedience (max 160)
- Show me your tits - Requires 10 effective sluttiness to showing her tits, or a combined 20 sluttiness and obedience.
    Breaks bare tits taboo. If Jennifer is slutty enough and has atleast 140 obedience players can end the scene with a tit fuck.
- Handjob - Requires 20 effective sluttiness to touching penis, or a combined 30 sluttiness and obedience
    Breaks relevant taboos. MC can convert to blowjob with atleast 35 sluttiness and kissing taboo break complete.
    If she likes or loves masturbating, she'll touch herself throughout
    Opinions on giving blowjobs and drinking cum also change dialogue.
- Show me your ass - Requires 30 effective sluttiness to baring pussy, or a combined 40 sluttiness and obedience
    With 140 obedience, Player's can turn it into a spanking session.
    Spanking session gets better dialogue with positive opinions of: Being Submissive, Being Fingered, and Anal Sex
Straight to blowjob and staright to sex scenes are also planned but not yet implemented.
The Saturday Morning Bills even is designed to give players the opportunity to begin building obedience with Jennifer early in the game.

Breakfast in Bed
The next event in Jennifer's obedience story is the introduction to Breakfast in Bed and requires 120 obedience.
It should trigger automatically with standard timing after the first Saturday Morning Bills event.
In the introduction event, Jennifer surprises MC with breakfast in bed as a way of saying thank you for helping out around the house and with bills.
She asks MC about his business and agrees to help him test serums in the evenings after she gets off work.
After the introduction, Breakfast in Bed unlocks as a repeatable event that MC can ask for from Jennifer the night before, and can also be triggered randomly.
MC can request breakfast in bed more frequently the higher Jennifer's obedience scores go.
Breakfast in Bed has Jennifer entertain MC while he eats and has 5 stages.
- Small Talk - the default
- Strip Tease - Requires 20 effective sluttiness
- Handjob - Requires first taboo quest complete and 30 effective sluttiness
- Blowjob - Requires 50 sluttiness
- Reverse Cowgirl - Requires 70 sluttiness and anal taboo quest complete

Jennifer's next obedience event occurs at 140 obedience with standard timing.
In this event, MC finds Jennifer cleaning house in her work clothes with an apron over it.
He convinces her to wear the apron instead of a shirt when around the house.
This event then unlocks the ability to gives her outfits to wear around the house.
For now, these outfits require atleast- a bra, panties, bottoms, and an apron.

This is the end of her obedience related content so far.

* Other Events *
Jennifer has a group scene with Rebecca and Lily.

Kaya does not become accessible until players have achieved Tier 1 serum creation, and then can be met during weekends at the Coffee Shop.

* Rebecca *
* Introduction *
Rebecca is MC's aunt, and has a daughter named Gabrielle.
You meet Rebecca automatically as part of the main game story events and it is time delayed only. MC currently has no options to delay or change the timing of the introduction.
Once Rebecca and Gabrielle move in with MC, she begins the move out process also automatically 18 to 24 days after moving in.
Once she begins to move out, MC can offer to help her move once per day during the morning, afternoon, or evening.
Completing move events adds to her stats as it progresses.
Once Rebecca and Gabrielle have moved into their own place, their introduction is complete.

* Solo Events *
Currently Rebecca only has one recurring event, where you drink wine with her at her place in the evening time slot.
This event acts as a dosing opportunity and also passes a stage of time.
This event has some progression already built in, with her sluttiness rating acting as the primary progression factor.
Sluttiness cutoffs for event progression are at: 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 sluttiness ratings.

It is a room entry event, so look on the map for an indicator that an event is ready.

Rebecca's third lust event requires 60 sluttiness and uses standard event timing. It also requires you to play the family card game scene (See Rebecca Teamups)
It triggers automatically after the family card game night on Wednesday nights.

Rebecca's fourth lust event is a quick follow up after the third event. It uses a Tier 1 time delay to determine her readiness for it.
It trigger's with MC activating her recurring wine drinking event. If MC is unable to give her a second glass of wine, it means her time delay has not yet passed.

[CHAR21]
* Starbuck *
* Introduction *
Starbuck is a character that is available for MC to meet from the beginning of the game.
You meet her by visiting the Sex Shop during open hours, which consister of
- Afternoons and Evenings on Monday thru Friday
- Morning and Afternoon on Saturday

Starbuck has a base storyline that involves investing in her shop. Her intro requires a $1000 investment from MC
After investing, Starbuck direct deposits a portion of her profits to MC's account daily.

* Sex Shop Investment *
Investment into the sex shop opens up in stages, with investment in basic, advanced, and then fetish merchandise.
The calculation for how much money Starbuck pays MC each day is a bit complicated.
First, we calculate a baseline investment percentage rate. This rate varies based on story progress, but it acts as a multiplier.
At the very beginning, this multiplier is just 1.0, but later in the game it can go as high as 7.0 or 8.0
Basic inventory is considered high margin, so it has the largest investment rate.
For basic inventory, the daily profit MC receives is (Amount invested * Investment Percentage Rate * .01)
For advanced and fetish inventory, this becomes (Amount invested * Investment Percentage Rate * 0.004)
Advanced inventory can be unlocked after story progress with Starbuck and requires $5000 initial investment
Fetish inventory can be unlocked after further story progress and requires a $15000 initial investment
After initial investments, basic, advanced, and fetish inventory can be further invested in an additional 5 times, totaling:
$6000 basic
$30000 advance
$90000 fetish
There is NO story requirements for additional investments, but they do increase the daily profits as described above.

In addition, there are 5 promotional material events available. Each promotional event increases the Investment Percentage Rate by 1%
Each promotional event unlocks through Starbuck's story arcs. Only one arc is required to unlock each event, but they unlock the fastest through her sluttiness events.
In addition, the third promo event requires an initial investment in advanced inventory
The fifth promo event requires initial investment in fetish inventory

* Love Story *
Starbuck's first love event requires basic inventory investment, 20 love, and uses standard event time.
It triggers automatically in a morning time slot.

This is end of Starbuck's love content currently implemented in game.

* Lust story *
This set of events involve STarbuck trying out new items she is stocking in the shop.
The first lust event requires 20 sluttiness, and is a room entry event when Starbuck is working at the sex shop in the evening only.
After the event, MC will gain a temporary perk that increases his foreplay skill and can purchased again at the sex shop weekly.

The second lust event requires 40 sluttiness and is a room entry event when Starbuck is working at the sex shop in the evening only.
After the MC, MC gains a temporary perk that increases his oral skill and can be repurchased weekly.

The third and fourth events have no yet been written, but are currently in the game in outline form, because they have purchasable perks locked behind them.
They follow the same patterns as above, requiring 60 and 80 sluttiness, respectively, and are room entry events in the evening at the shop using standard timing.

* Obedience Story *
The first obedience event with Starbuck requires 120 obedience, and is a room entry event at the sex shop in the evening time slot.

The second obedience event is a limit break style event. The intro requires 140 obedience, has standard timing, and is a room entry event.
After the intro, follow up with Starbuck two days later. The cycle can be broken with either 3 repeats, making Starbuck love skimpy outfits, or if MC has invested in advanced inventory.
If we fail to break the cycle, Starbuck loses 10 obedience. We can retry the event again with 140 obedience.

Once we complete the second event, you can talk to Starbuck and customize her wardrobe for while she is working as a cashier.
For now, outfits added to this wardrobe must be between 20 and 40 sluttiness and must not exposed her tits or vagina.

This is the end of Starbuck's obedience content currently implemented in game.

[TMUSTAREB]
* Starbuck and Rebecca *
The Starbuck and Rebecca teamup is triggered thru both girls obedience storylines.
