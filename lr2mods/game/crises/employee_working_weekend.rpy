###Scene Idea: Working Weekend
#
#   In this scene, MC is working on the weekend when the business is otherwise closed.
#   Girl comes in to grab something from their locker or workspace and finds player working.
#   If not slutty, girl is just impressed by the MC work ethic.
#   If girl is a little slutty, she may offer to tease MC or give a blowjob
#   If girl is very slutty, girl may take the opportunity to striptease
#
