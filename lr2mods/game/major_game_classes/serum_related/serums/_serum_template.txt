## SERUM TRAIT GUIDELINES ##
# These are some guidelines for how serum traits are priced out.
# Each tier of serum trait should provide 2*(tier+1) aspect points.
# Add 1 extra aspect point per point of attention.

# Serum trait functions. Each serum trait can have up to four key functions: on_apply, on_remove, on_turn, and on_day. These are run at various points throughout the game.
