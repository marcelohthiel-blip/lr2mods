This is in ALPHA. Only a few storylines have been converted to this system so far.
Story Path related milestones are detailed in Discord

THIS IS NOT A RAPE TOGGLE. THERE IS NO FEAR, CRYING, TRAUMATIZING RAPE IN THIS GAME
So far only added to Nora content


Content: Nora
Major update. Completely rewriting her intro and involvement with players. She takes a more active time with helping players start their business.
Prologue: refreshed prologue slightly changing Stephanie and Nora's story involvement. Nora is now available from the start of the game, with Nora and Stephanie's team up being accessible the first week of the game, every Saturday evening at the bar.
Sluttiness arc highlights Nora's dom personality, but it uses the player's non consent preference.
Obedience arc highlights corrupting Nora in the University setting, eventually causing her to use serums to corrupt the university dean, who is one of the five city council members.
Love arc is not planned for this update.
Additional story: Nora begins espionage of a competing serum company. Gives players access to 5 new "unstable" serum traits that get significantly better as they are mastered.
Stephanie is included in multiple Nora story events, but this is not considered a Stephanie update.
